Each program in this repo covers a different problem:

Names_Scores.c - A solution to Project Euler problem 22: Names Scores
- Sort the provided list of names (0022_names.txt) in alphabetic order.
- Calculate a score for each name by finding an alphabetic value for each name and multiplying that value by its alphabetic position in the list. For example, COLIN is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53 points and is 938th in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 * 53 = 49714.
- Find the sum of all the name scores in the file.
